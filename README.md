# LAOCOONTE: Intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Overview

**LAOCOONTE** is an **AI-powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** designed to detect **anomalies in network traffic**, particularly **DDoS attacks and emerging cyber threats**. By leveraging a **Convolutional Autoencoder (CNN 1D) for feature extraction** and **One-Class SVM for anomaly detection**, this system adapts to unknown threats without relying on **predefined attack signatures**.

**Key Features:**
- **Unsupervised learning** for detecting **zero-day threats**.
- **CNN-based Autoencoder** to extract meaningful network traffic patterns.
- **One-Class SVM** trained exclusively on normal traffic for anomaly detection.
- **Robust to evolving attack strategies**—not limited to known attack patterns.
- **Scalable and adaptable** for different network environments.

## Motivation

Traditional IDS solutions rely on **predefined attack signatures**, making them vulnerable to **new cyber threats**. LAOCOONTE adopts a **proactive approach**, learning normal network behavior to identify deviations **without prior attack knowledge**. 

Inspired by **Laocoön, the Trojan priest who warned against the Greek’s deceptive gift**, this system aims to **uncover hidden threats disguised as normal network traffic**.
